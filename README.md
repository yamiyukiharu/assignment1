# Description

# Task
Implement a react app that looks as close as possible to the mockup.

In addition to the layout, you are also expected to implement the following functionality:

1. When the user clicks the All tab, they should see All Teams
2.  When the user clicks the Favorites tab, they should only see their Favorited Teams
3.  When the user clicks on the Archived tab, they should only see Archived teams.

You are expected to interface with a mock API response that you can find at the end of this exercise. Ingest the data however you see fit. You are not required to load the data directly from the file. You can be as creative as youâ€™d like with the UX.
